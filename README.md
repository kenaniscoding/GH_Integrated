check out the makeup and absence slip for reference
### TASKS
- refactor the code
## GOOD FEATURES
- Automatic email to LC admin, teacher, and student/parent
- Automatic pdf generator with the email
- User friendly Interface for the admin and student/parent
- Loading screen while the pdf and email are sending
- An admin login where they can approve or disapprove an absence (the student/parent would also be automatically informed through an email)
## FALL BACKS (the bad)
- Sending emails and generating pdf takes around a minute
- Requires an email that has an app password (see more [here](https://github.com/kenaniscoding/GH_MakeUpSlip))
